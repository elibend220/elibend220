### About Me
I am an AI Native System Architect focused on the emerging field of AI Augmented Development. 

Instead of traditional manual coding, I specialize in Semantic Orchestration leveraging advanced LLMs to engineer complex, mission critical infrastructure at high velocity. My expertise lies in closing the gap between architectural vision and executable code.

### Neus AI platform (Independent R&D)
The Neus AI platform is an integrated ecosystem comprising over 700,000 lines of proprietary code. It serves as a comprehensive foundation for autonomous security, orchestration, and intelligence.

* **Neus Security V.3**
The core architectural framework providing heavy duty autonomous system protection and deep threat mitigation logic.

* **Neus Guard V.5**
A lightweight intelligent sensor designed for high efficiency. It operates as a standalone entity or integrates seamlessly into the broader platform for real time observability and proactive threat detection.

* **Neus Matrix V.1 (SaaS)**
A high scale platform for infrastructure orchestration and the management of complex autonomous agent workflows.

* **Neus LLM V.1**
A proprietary language model architecture optimized for high precision semantic analysis and security operations.

### Technical Methodology
The platform utilizes a Human in the Loop (HITL) workflow to ensure surgical precision over autonomous execution layers.

* **Sovereign Semantic Firewall**
Engineered to protect RAG workflows from adversarial prompt injections and data poisoning.

* **Multi Language Orchestration**
Seamless integration of Golang for system performance and Python for advanced logic and AI capabilities.

* **Technological Stack and Observability**
Deep system observability is a core component of my methodology, utilizing kernel level introspection via eBPF as part of a broader, diverse technological stack. This is combined with formal logic verification using Z3 Prover to ensure absolute systemic integrity.

### Vision
The code is a commodity; the architecture is the sovereign asset.
