# Hi, I'm Eliyahu Ben David 
​Founder & Lead Architect of NEUS
Pioneering AI-Native Security Architectures.

​About Me
​I am a AI-Native System Architect focused on the emerging field of AI-Augmented Development.

Instead of traditional coding, I specialize in Semantic Orchestration—leveraging advanced LLMs to engineer complex, mission-critical infrastructure at high velocity. My expertise lies in closing the gap between architectural vision and executable code.

​*Current Project:* NEUS Smart Security
​I am architecting NEUS, a multi-agent security system built using a Human-in-the-Loop AI workflow.

​*The Methodology:* Rapid prototyping and deployment of high-performance modules (Go/Python) using AI-driven code generation.

*​The System:* A Sovereign "Semantic Firewall" that protects RAG workflows from adversarial attacks.

​*Tech Stack:* Orchestrated ecosystem combining Golang (Sentinel) and Python (Overmind), deployed via automated CI/CD pipelines.
