# Hi, I'm Eliyahu Ben David 
​Founder & Lead Architect of NEUS
Pioneering AI-Native Security Architectures.

​About Me
​I am a AI-Native System Architect focused on the emerging field of AI-Augmented Development.
Instead of traditional coding, I specialize in Semantic Orchestration—leveraging advanced LLMs to engineer complex, mission-critical infrastructure at high velocity. My expertise lies in closing the gap between architectural vision and executable code.
​🛡️ Current Project: NEUS Smart Security
​I am architecting NEUS, a multi-agent security system built using a Human-in-the-Loop AI workflow.
​The Methodology: Rapid prototyping and deployment of high-performance modules (Go/Python) using AI-driven code generation.
​The System: A Sovereign "Semantic Firewall" that protects RAG workflows from adversarial attacks.
​Tech Stack: Orchestrated ecosystem combining Golang (Sentinel) and Python (Overmind), deployed via automated CI/CD pipelines.
